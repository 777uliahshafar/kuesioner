This template uses [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (and [csvsimple](https://ctan.org/pkg/csvsimple)) to produce a questionnaire with a semantic differntial scale.

As an example, we use the items of the [GodSpeed scale](http://www.bartneck.de/2008/03/11/the-godspeed-questionnaire-series/) described by _Bartneck, Croft and Kulic (2008)_. For adapting these items, just change the `CSV`-file. The order can be randomised with using, e.g., [https://www.random.org/lists/](https://www.random.org/lists/).
